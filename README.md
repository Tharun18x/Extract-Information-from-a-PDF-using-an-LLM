# 🧠 PDF Q&A with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This project lets you **ask questions from a PDF file** using a large language model (LLM). It uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** by combining OpenAI's GPT with a local **vector database (FAISS)** for efficient document search.

- 📦 Stores them in a vector DB (FAISS)
- ❓ Lets you ask questions — answers come from both the PDF and GPT model
